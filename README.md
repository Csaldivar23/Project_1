The Covid Economic Impact.

In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic swept across the U.S. leading to numerous adverse effects. In this Project we focus on the impact of Covid and its affect on the U.S economy.
We will look at and compare the percentage of hospitalizations, unemployment rate, and inflation over the course of 3 years. In order to collect and compare data we have
each collected separate data points and merged them together into one dataframe. Harriet collected data from the CDC on the percentage of hospitalizations for Covid in the
U.S from 2020-2023 via csv. file. Rebecca pulled the U.S unemployment rate data from 2015-2024 using the API from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). Cesar used Fred 
as well via csv. file to collect data on inflation in the U.S from 2015-2024. We all have cleaned and organized the individual data and then merged those into one dataframe 
where we all have worked together to analyze the data and create visualizations to show the effects of covid on the U.S economy.
